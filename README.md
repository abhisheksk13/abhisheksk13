# 👋 Hey, I'm ABHISHEK SK

> _“The code you write makes you a developer. The bugs you fix make you a **problem solver**.”_ 🛠️

I'm a **tech explorer** who loves crafting beautiful frontends, building tools with Python, and diving into data structures with Java. I don't just write code — I **create, experiment, debug, and evolve.**

## 🧩 Quick Facts

- 🧠 Self-taught web and Python developer
- 🔥 Java for DSA ninja-in-training
- 🧰 Currently building mini projects & utilities for fun
- 🎯 Always in “learn → build → break → fix” mode

## 🎨 Aesthetic Goals

I believe code can be beautiful. From pixel-perfect UI to well-commented Python scripts, I care about:

- Clean indentation & naming ✨
- Reusable logic 🧠
- Responsive layouts 📱
- Human-readable comments 💬
